No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure,\n                                        but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter\n                                        consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues\n                                        or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally\n                                        circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take\n                                        a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to\n                                        obtain some advantage from it?

Blood is needed by women with complications during pregnancy and childbirth, children with severe anaemia, often resulting from malaria or malnutrition, accident victims and surgical and cancer patients.\n\nThere is a constant need for a regular supply of blood because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever and wherever it is needed.\n\nBlood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person – the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is separated into its components – red cells, platelets and plasma – which can be used individually for patients with specific conditions.\n                                        </p>\n                                   </div>\n                                   {/* Intro box end */}\n
